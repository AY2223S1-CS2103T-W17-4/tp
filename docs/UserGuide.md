PleaseHireUs (PHU) is a **desktop app for managing internships for computer science students 
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, PHU can manage your internship details done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/COMPANY_NAME`, `COMPANY_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Grab`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/COMPANY_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Jane Street t/$$$` or as `n/Jane Street`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/$$$`, `t/free lunch t/transport` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/COMPANY_NAME pr/APPLICATION_PROCESS`, `pr/APPLICATION_PROCESS n/COMPANY_NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `n/Bytedance n/Tiktok`, only `n/Tiktok` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
