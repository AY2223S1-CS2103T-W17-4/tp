### Project: PleaseHireUs

PleaseHireUs (PHU) is a **desktop app for managing internships, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Undo command
  * What it does: Allow users to undo the command that modified the internship book.
  * Justification: This feature improves the app significantly because user can conveniently undo any unintended command.
  * Credits: `VersionedInternshipBook` class is adapted from [Addressbook Level 4](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/VersionedAddressBook.java)
  
* **New Feature**: Redo command
  * What it does: Allow users to redo the command that was previously undone.
  * Justification: This feature improves the app significantly because user can conveniently redo any command that has been undone.
  * Credits: `VersionedInternshipBook` class is adapted from [Addressbook Level 4](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level4/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/VersionedAddressBook.java)
