PleaseHireUs (PHU) is a desktop app for managing internships, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, PHU can get your internship management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the add command that allows the user to add an internship.
    * What it does: allows the user to add an internship and its details (such as position, application process, and date) to be managed by the app.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link]()

* **Project management**:
    * Managed releases `v1.3` - `v1.5rc` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Updated the GUI color scheme (Pull requests [\#33](), [\#34]())

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `add` [\#72]()
    * Developer Guide:
        *   * Added implementation details of the `delete` feature.

* **Community**:

    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())
