### Project: PleaseHireUs

PleaseHireUs (PHU) is a **desktop app for managing internships, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: A statistic bar chart
    * What it does: Provides an overview of the number of applications in each application process using a stacked bar chart.
    * Justification: This is a quality of life feature for users to get a rough idea regarding the state of their applications
