PleaseHireUs (PHU) is a desktop app for managing internships, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, PHU can get your internship management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.Given below are my contributions to the project
