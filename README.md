* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _Please Hire Us_) used for managing internships details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Please Hire Us` (`PHU` for short) because as students we are constantly looking for internships
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Please Hire Us Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w17-4.github.io/tp/)**.
